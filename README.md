## 💬 About Me

I don’t claim to know everything — but I’m the kind of developer who figures things out, adapts quickly, and gets things done.

I build projects to learn — and I learn best by building.  
Whether it’s web apps, CLI tools, or system-level code, I enjoy exploring ideas that make me think and create.
